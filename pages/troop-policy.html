                    Each parent should take an active role in
                    assisting their son in achieving the necessary rank advancements as he
                    progresses through Scouting to ultimately attain the rank of Eagle.
                    Although the Troop places a great deal of responsibility on the
                    Scouts for their advancement, it is important that each parent monitors
                    and encourages their Scout's progress. In order for the Scouts to grow as members
                    of the Troop and as good citizens, it is important that they learn to take
                    responsibility for their Scouting career. When it's necessary for a
                    Scout to contact a Troop Leader, parents are encourage to insist that the
                    Scout make those contacts, not the parents. <b>Parents are encouraged to refer to their

                <dt>Empowering boys to be leaders represents
                    the core of Scouting. The Scouts themselves develop the Troop's
                    program, and then take responsibility for figuring out how they will
                    achieve their goals. Scouts learn by doing, and what they do is lead
                    their patrols and the Troop. The Troop is divided into patrols, each
                    patrol consisting of 6 to 8 Scouts. Troop 108 relies upon the Scouts
                    serving in leadership positions to plan and manage the Troop's activities.
                    An important part of the leadership
                    experience is to deal with adversity with resolve and persistence.
                    For that reason, it is important that the Troop provide Scouts the
                    “<b>opportunity to fail</b>”, <span style="COLOR: black">with the
                        protection of a safety net.</span> This can be one of the most
                    challenging aspects of serving as an adult leader in a Scout Troop.
                    There is nothing more difficult than watching a group of Scouts
                    argue over the right direction to go or the proper way to start a fire or
                    the correct way to prepare dinner, knowing that the outcome of the
                    discussion may be less than the optimal result. Within the boundaries of safety, however,
                    it is absolutely essential that the leaders permit the adverse results to
                    occur and assist the Scouts in learning the lessons that come from such
                    experiences. It's not unlikely that your scout may come home from an
                    outdoor activity cold, wet or hungry on occasion. It's the Troop's
                    task to ensure that your <b>Scout is safe and learns a positive lesson
                        from experience.</b> It's the wet campout and the blackened pancakes
                    of which Boy Scout legends are made. Using this method, each Scout
                    will learn about preparation, responsibility and accountability.</dt>

            <div>
                <dt>Patrols are the building blocks of a
                    Scout Troop. Each patrol is a small group of boys working together
                    as a team to make the patrol a success. Each patrol has a unique name and
                    develops a patrol yell, cheer, and patrol flag which gives the patrol its
                    own identity. In Troop 108 the patrols sit together during meetings
                    and are assigned responsibilities on a rotational basis for various parts
                    of the meeting such as the opening, the closing and pre-meeting set up of
                    Troop/Scout ceremonies. The Scouts also plan their participation in
                    Troop campouts as patrols. They tent, cook and eat as patrols.
                    Each Patrol is assigned Troop equipment such as patrol box and a
                    stove. The patrol is responsible for making sure that the equipment
                    is in working order and is available for use at each campout.
                    Failure to meet these responsibilities may well result in a weekend
                    out under the stars with no hot meals without the benefit of a stove!
                    As Lord Baden Powell, the founder of the Scouting Movement once
                    observed, <b>“The object of the patrol method is not as much saving the
                        Scoutmaster trouble as to give responsibility to the boy.” </b></dt>
            </div>
            <div>
                <dt><span style="COLOR: black">Troop 108
                        patrols may consist of Scouts of diverse ages, this contributes to the
                        “<b>boy run Troop</b>” concept. This patrol organizatio</span>n creates
                    another opportunity for boys to teach and mentor other boys. It also
                    presents more opportunities for leadership and helps to provide continuity
                    in the Troop Program and Scout skills over time. In addition, it
                    gives the older Scouts a sense of ownership in their own organization.
                    With the guidance and approval of the
                    Scoutmaster, members of each patrol may elect one of their own to serve as
                    their Patrol Leader. Troop 108 may conduct elections once a year for the purpose of
                    electing Patrol
                    Leaders and other junior leaders in the
                    Troop. Becoming a Patrol Leader is often a Scout's first opportunity
                    to develop practical leadership skills. His responsibilities include
                    taking a leading role in planning and conducting the patrol's
                    participation in Troop activities, encouraging other patrol members to
                    complete advancement requirements; representing the patrol at the Green
                    Bar meeting, and ensuring that the Patrol arrives at Troop Campouts with
                    the appropriate equipment and supplies. The patrol may also elect
                    other leaders such as an Assistant Patrol Leader and/or Patrol
                    Quartermaster.</dt>
            </div>
            <div>
                <dt>One way in which Troop108 implements the
                    “<b>boy run Troop</b>” concept is through the Green Bar Meetings. The Green
                    Bar Meeting is a planning meeting attended the Senior Patrol Leader, his
                    assistant, the Patrol Leaders and their assistants, Troop Scribe, and
                    adult Scout Leaders / advisors as appropriate. The Green Bar Meeting
                    is used to plan Troop programs and activities. It also provides the Troop
                    long-range direction with an annual program planning meeting that lays out
                    the Troop's calendar for the coming year. The Green Bar Meetings are
                    held at least once a month, typically the second Thursday
                    evening of the month. All
                    Patrol Leaders and/or the Assistant Patrol Leader, a Scribe, the Senior
                    Patrol Leader, the Assistant Senior Patrol Leaders, and Junior Assistant
                    Scoutmasters, an the adult Scout Leader / advisor must attend.
                    During these meetings the Green Bar Members review and evaluate the
                    Troop's most recent activity, plans the next month's activity, and plans
                    the Troop meetings for the next month. </dt>
            </div>
            <div>
                <dt>Wolf Patrol: At the discretion of the
                    Scoutmaster, the Wolf Patrol may be formed using first-year Scouts.
                    Troop 108 has developed the Wolf Patrol to help assist a new Scout
                    to transition from Webelo's into the Boy Scout Program. Formation of
                    the Wolf Patrol is a process of ensuring continuity during this transition
                    period of the new Scouts. Adult leaders of the Troop work with the
                    Wolf Patrol members to insure they have a great start in Boy Scouting.
                    After the Adult Leaders feel they are ready, the Wolf's are assigned
                    to one of the existing patrols. Parental
                    input may be solicited to assist the Scoutmaster in assigning the Wolf to
                    a permanent patrol.</dt>
            </div>
            <div>
                <dt>All Scouts are expected to attend Troop
                    meetings on a regular basis. Troop meetings are typically held on
                    Monday evenings throughout the year. The meetings begin promptly at
                    6:45 p.m. in the winter and 6:30 in the summer. Generally meetings
                    will last no more that an hour. A calendar is developed at the
                    beginning of the Scouting year that identifies Troop meetings, campouts,
                    and other important dates and events. Changes or additions are
                    announced at the Troop meetings, via e-mail, the Troop Web Site or the
                    Troop Newsletter.</dt>

            position will be evaluated by the Troop Leadership and Scoutmaster before
            a rank advancement is granted. It will be determined whether he
            performed the duties of the position or just wore the patch. It's
            the Scout's responsibility to pursue these positions. No one will
            elect or appoint a Scout to the position without the Scout first taking
            the initiative and seeking out the position. </p>

        <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As a Scout progresses through a rank, upon
            the Scoutmaster or Assistant Scoutmaster review, he should have a Scout
            who is First Class or above sign off the requirements in his Scout
            handbook as he learns them. An adult leadership review is<b> </b>to
            verify accurate completion of all rank advancement requirements.

            Scout may complete a requirement towards First Class while still working
            towards his Tenderfoot Rank. However, he must earn the Ranks in
            order. Once a Scout has completed all requirements for a Rank
            (except "Scout Spirit", Scoutmaster Conference &amp; Board of Review) he
            should request the Advancement Chairperson's, Scoutmaster or Assistant

            Scout Account:
            </b>Each Scout has an account established upon joining the Troop.
            The individual accounts are based on credits earned via Troop fund
            raisers and participation in monthly paper drives. A Scout may use the
            credits in his account to purchase Scouting uniforms, camping equipment
            and supplies, and for summer camp and/or high adventure camping.
            Reimbursement for uniforms, camping equipment and or Scouting items is
            accomplished by presenting a receipt for the items purchased to the
            Scoutmaster or Troop Treasurer. The Troop Treasurer will issue a
            check for the cost of the Scout item purchased. If a Scout leaves
            the Troop and joins another Troop the credits will be transferred, upon
            request, to the Scouts new Troop. When a Scout turns 18 or
            leaves Scouting and has any unused credits, those credits will not be
            reimbursement and will be rolled over into the Troops general fund. <b>A
                Scout or the parent of Scout may request their account credit be
                transferred to a younger brother/sibling when that Scout turns 18 years of
                age or leaves the Troop, or the Scouting program.</b>

            Troop Monthly Paper
            Drive: </b>Since the 1940's the Troop has performed a monthly
            community service, referred to as the Paper Drive. On the first
            Saturday of each month members of the Troop (Scouts, Adult Leaders,
            Scouters &amp; parents) meet at the East Greenville Fire House parking lot
            at 8am. The Scouts are organized and assigned to adults with trucks, and
            each adult is assigned a street to collect recyclable paper and cardboard.
            The recyclables are then transferred from the trucks to containers
            provide by the Borough of East Greenville. The entire process takes
            about 1 &amp; half hours, to complete. The Borough in turn gives the
            Troop a monthly donation for this service.

                summer camp. Any scout that participates in 9 or more paper
