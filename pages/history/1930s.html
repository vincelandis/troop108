        <strong>1930-31 Activities Increase</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        The Troop seemed to speed up its program in l930 & 31. <em style="color: red;">On Feb.22, 1931, a contingent of
            14 scouts attended the
            Valley Forge Pilgrimage, an event that still takes place to this day,</em> on the Saturday following
        Washington's
        Birthday. <em style="color: red;">In 1931 the Troop also became affiliated with New Goshenhoppen Reformed Church
            and started holding
            meetings in St. John's Chapel.</em>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        The new scoutmaster in 1930 was Quinton Swenk, a Sunday School teacher and known to be a great lover on birds.
        Mr. Swenk was to serve two years and when the need arose during World War II for a Scoutmaster he returned to
        serve three more years. He also was committee chairman for two years (1946 - 47).

    <p style="font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">
        <strong>1932</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Records are almost non-existent during the next four years although it is known the Troop was a member of the
        Northern District of Valley Forge Council. However, <strong>William 'Bill' Beahm became Scoutmaster in
            1932</strong> and he was
        subsequently to serve for nine years during which the Troop made great strides. <em
            style="color: red;">Scoutmaster Beahm was
            incidentally one of the original Scouts in the Troop in 1924.</em>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Under Scoutmaster Beahm a movement started to obtain a tract of land in order for the Troop to better conduct a
        varied program of activities. A committee under Chairman Warren Kreider looked at a tract on Mill Hill. They
        soon found a three and one-half acre tract on the property of Daniel Gerhart, west of the Perkiomen Creek and a
        15 minute walk from Millside, near Palm.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <em style="color: red;">At a cost of $100, the following voted to purchase the tract: Victor Ensminger, Arthur
            Kranszley, Victor J.
            Moyer Sr., Fred Diehi, Warren Kreider, Melvin Mack, Paul Heimbach, Robert Ritter and Elmer Roth. Mr. Kreider
            was
            authorized to seek a clear deed for the properly. The transaction was duly consummated on April 1,
            1937.</em> Also in
        1937, Scouts Merritt Derr and Eliman Wentling represented the Troop in the First National Jamboree in
        Washington, DC. In October, 1937, the Troop committee passed a motion to have a newly dug well lined with stone,
        a wood covering placed thereon, and a pump purchased.

    <p style="font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">
        <strong>1937 Log Cabin Planned</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        On the suggestion of Robert Ritter, the Troop was able to obtain discarded utility poles for a log cabin. These
        were trucked to the site in December, 1937 and with this, the cabin building project became a reality. Plans
        were secured from Valley Forge Scout headquarters and in July, 1938 a committee of Mr. Ensminger, Meyer, Diehl,
        Heimbach and Kreider designated a location.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Meanwhile other Troop activities continued. Under Mr. Ensminger's supervision, hemlock trees were obtained and
        planted on the land tract and today the trees can be seen near the old archery range. Pre-camporees were also
        staged in the late 30's with the leading patrol as the representative to the District Camporee. Today all
        patrols enter the Camporee. <em style="color: red;">In 1938 the Indian Patrol also gained a first place for
            their exhibit on 'Highlights
            of Scouting' at the Hatfield Fair.</em>

    <p style="font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">
        <strong>1939</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <em style="color: red;">Excellent progress was made on the cabin in 1939.</em> The plot was staked and excavated in May, <em style="color: red;">concrete was put
        into the foundation in June through Mr. Ensminger and Elwood Mumbauer's efforts, and the foundation for the
        fireplace and floor completed by September.</em> Funds were solicited to the amount of $102.35 and with some paid
        labor, <em style="color: red;">the roof was placed in January 1940.</em>
