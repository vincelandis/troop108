        Funds were solicited to the amount of $102.35 and with some paid labor, <em style="color: red;">the roof was
            placed in January
            1940. </em>Paul Underkoffer extended a loan of $400 to pay bills for total
        completion by <em style="color: red;">December, 1940 when mortar was
            placed between the logs in the walls to winterize the cabin. Exterior steps were placed the
            following (1941) summer and by March, 1943 the cabin was debt-free.</em>

        Activities continued during World War II. The cabin was painted, pup tents were purchased and pre-camporee's
        conducted.

        <strong>Memorial Acres</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        A movement arose to
        purchase two memorial acres of land at Camp Delmont at a cost of $25 per acre. By March 1946, the
        two acres were secured and on motion by Lyman Kiebe and a second by Clarence Reitnauer, they were to be
        dedicated to Warren B. Kreider, district commissioner of Perkiomen District, and to former Scouts of East
        Greenville Troop No.1 who had made the supreme sacrifice during World War II. <strong>Kreider, who was to
            receive the
            Silver Beaver in 1947</strong>, was honored for his untiring efforts and devotion to youth in the
        furthering of scouting in the Upper Perkiomen area.

        <strong>Additional Land Purchase</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <em style="color: red;">In January, 1946, Mr. Francis Adams, who owned a small farm near the scout
            property, was contacted relative to the possibility of purchasing an additional 3 and a half acres
            of land from him. In May the deal was consummated at a cost of $100 with Frederick Bieler as
            chairman of the purchasing committee.</em>Further improvements at the cabin included the purchase of a
        Coleman lantern since there was no electricity available. A fire extinguisher was also added to the
        equipment at the cabin.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <em style="color: red;">In the Fall of 1946, the regular meeting place of the Troop was changed
            from St. John's Chapel to the present Scout Hall on N. Main Street. </em>
        A few meetings during the year had also
        been held in the fire hall building then located at Fourth and Main streets.

        <strong>1947</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        In 1947 a water problem
        arose when it was discovered the existing well water was unsafe for drinking purposes. The condition existed
        as such until 1953 when a new artesian well was constructed. In November, 1947, new fluorescent lights were
        placed in the Scout Hall by Merritt Derr and the following summer, the hall was renovated with new plaster,
        painting and the installation of lockers. Although the Troop was known for long tenures of their
        Scoutmasters, the 1948-53 period was to see a different Scoutmaster for six consecutive years.
