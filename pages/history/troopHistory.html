        East Greenville Troop 108 was first chartered in 1924. Serving the community of East Greenville and the Upper
        Perkiomen Valley area, we are an active Boy Scout troop which camps out at least once a month, all year round.

        <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Although it has been recorded that an East Greenville Boy Scout Troop functioned as early as 1917, <em style="color: red;">the official
        starting date is recognized as July, 1924 when the original Troop No.1 was organized by a Group of Citizens</em>
        under Professor Clayton W. Wetring who was the East Greenville High School principal at that time.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        In the earlier Troop formed Sept. 8, 1917 under the auspices of New Goshenhoppen Reformed Church Sunday School,
        the first leader was the Honorable Henry L. Snyder, then principal of East Greenville High School. The assistant
        Leaders were Foster C. Hillegass, Warren G. Fluck and Wilford Moll.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        However these were the troubled years of World War I and after functioning for about one year, theTroop combined
        with a Pennsburg movement as the Penn-Green Troop. <em style="color: red;">Records are vague at this point and five years later the East
        Greenville Troop wasofficially activated and has been functioning continuously now for over 100 years.</em>
