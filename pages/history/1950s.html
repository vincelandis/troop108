        Activities in 1950 again included participation in a District Halloween Party at Pennsburg Scout Cabin and the
        usual
        Christmas candy sales project to help Troop finances. A Troop assembly program was given in February at East
        Greenville High School and <em style="color: red;">in summer (1950) Floyd Treffinger, Kenneth Mohr Jr., Donald
            Fiorito and Charles Bieler

        <strong>New Well (1954)</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        The present water well was dug at the Scout cabin in May, 1954 by Joseph Mayer to provide an adequate water
        supply since the old well had been not suitable for use since 1947. A new lighting system was also installed
        (July) and new tents were purchased. Warren Groff served as provisional leader for the Troop at Delmont in July
        and this was to be the <strong style="color: red;">only time in the history of the Troop</strong> camping at
        Delmont that a provisional leader was
        provided.

        John Hagenbuch assumed the Scoutmaster role in 1955 and was to serve faithfully in that capacity for six years.
        The Friendship Dinner was held in St. John's Chapel in April and the new Troop 108 flag was presented at this
        time. Insurance on Leaders and Scouts was also instituted in June, 1955.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Scoutmaster Hagenbuch and Karl Winsch, assistant Scoutmaster, participated in a kickoff parade in Philadelphia
        for the Resica Falls Scout Reservation. <strong>East Greenville Troop had a Scout band at this time of 16
            members</strong> (12
        from East Greenville) under the direction of Robert Marshman, then band director at Upper Perkiomen High School.
        The band led the 23rd Division (General Nash) in the parade. Troop and Explorer Leaders in October attended an
        Explor-Ama at Resica Falls to help in cleaning out campsites and blaze trails for the new camp which was to open
        in July 1957. <em style="color: red;">The first patch for Resica Falls was issued for taking part in the cleanup
            and East Greenville
            Troop members are known have a few of them.</em>

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Dennis Reiter received the Lutheran Church Award in February, <em style="color: red;">1957 and Karl Winsch, who
            was to become the
            Scoutmaster in 1961, received the Eagle Scout Award.</em> In July the Troop camped for the first time at
        Resica Falls
        under the leadership of Ernest Marks, Richard Moyer and Karl Winsch. Also in July, Scoutmaster Hagenbuch,
        Michael Oppelt and James Hagenbuch attended the National Jamboree at Valley Forge.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        In October the Troop had a booth at the Devon Scouting Fair. The Troop camped out in Revolutionary (Valley
        Forge) War style in Jan. 17-19, 1958 at French Creek State Park when snow blanketed the ground and it was very
        cold. All apparently recovered to attend the Friendship Dinner on Feb.15 in the high school cafeteria when
        Dennis Reiter received the Eagle Rank. In July, the Troop again attended camp at Resica Falls.

        <strong>1959 Camping Report</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        During 1959 we were very fortunate to have participated in many camping outdoor activities. Our ranks include
        boys from all walks of life. We had 34 boys participating in our camping experiences, with a total of 415 days
        of camping, an average of 12.2 days per boy.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Scanning our 1959 Camping log, we note that we spent a week of fun and camping at Resica Falls in the Pocono
        Mountains. Other camping trips included hikes to Mill Hill, pre-camporee at our cabin in May, the District
        camporee at Camp Delmont in October and four weekends at out cabin - one each in March, April, June and
        November.
        In September a colorful camping trip to Potter County took us 600 miles from home base, making trips to the Ice
        Mine in Coudersport and visiting the Grand Canyon at Wellsboro. On overnight camping trips boys conducted
        themselves according to Scouting traditionâ€¦cooking out, trailing, doing wood lore, compass work, campcraft, etc.
        For our year-end camping experience, we had our annual Christmas dinner and party at our cabin. This has been
        our camping log for 1959, an exciting, interesting and enjoyable one. Four of our Explorers Scouts also had the
        pleasure of the scenic wonders of Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, a true scouting trip in every sense. These
        boys were Bruce Heimbach, Gerald Schantz, Paul Shellaway and John Rosanski.

        <strong>1959 Advancement Report</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Our 1959 advancement enjoyed one of its best years in the troop history. We enhanced our ranks with 13
        tenderfoot Scouts, 4 Second Class Scouts, 5 First Class Scouts, 5 Star Scouts, 1Life Scout, 1Eagle Scout and
        1Gold Palm Scout. The boys earned 89 merit badges during the past year. It is our hope that in 1960 our
        advancement will exceed even that of this year.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        There were seven Boards of review and seven Courts of Honor and four Tenderfoot Investiture Services held in
        1959.

        In 1959 the Friendship Dinner was held in the park pavilion at New Goshenhoppen Park and on May 23 the Troop
        participated in Act-o-rama at Temple University Stadium, Philadelphia. <em style="color: red;">In July, the
            Troop was at Great Bend Camp
            at Resica Falls for the first and only time.</em> The leaders were Ernest Marks and Floyd Treffinger. On
        Sept. 11-13,
        the first annual father-son camping trip was staged on a farm near Coudersport.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        The Jubilee year of 1960 will bring even greater activities in which we are going to participate. It should be a
        grand and glorious Jubilee Anniversary for both the Troop and the Post.
