        <strong>Word From The 1970 Troop Committee</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Slogan BOY POWER, MAN POWER may be to some people just a slogan but to the men on the Troop and Post Committee of 108 it is a way of life. We sometimes set a fast pace for young boys just entering the Troop and expect a lot of patience from the older boys, but this is life in general. We had an average of 19 men attending our Troop Committee meetings, and anticipate a larger turnout in 1971. This should indicate some of the interest the men on our Troop Committee have in the boys of the Troop & Post.
In the coming year of 1971 we will have two projects to undertake. One is a program from Council called SOAR which means Save Our American Resources. The other project concerns three Adirondacks that we would like to build on the grounds at the cabin.
The men on the Troop Committee would like to extend their appreciation to all the people and business places that help to support one of the oldest Troops in the Valley Forge Council sponsored by a group of citizens.
With the completion of this years Adult Training Course, of which there are 7 sessions, we now have a total of 15 men trained. Another 6 men have partial training.

        <strong>1970 Camping and Hiking Report</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Another year has passed for the Scouts of Troop 108 and it has proved to be a vintage year in all aspects of the Scouting program. The Scouts can be proud of their record of Merit Badges passed, the many advancements they have made in rank, and the effort they put into their money making programs. They would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who helped in any way and all those who patronized their programs.
        The year of 1970 started with two nights of camping at the cabin on Jan. 30th & 31st. There were 31 Scouts and 7 leaders on this outing. The annual Valley Forge Pilgrimage was made on Feb. 21 and had 25 Scouts and 12 Leaders making the trip. On March 13-15, the Scouts camped in cabins at Camp Acahela. This is the Council's camp for Wyoming Valley Council and is located in the Poconos, this is the trip that was postponed in Dec. because of the snow. The weekend was spent sledding as there was plenty of snow on the ground. The 7 Leaders that made the trip did the cooking for the 24 Scouts.
        The annual pre-Camporee was held on April 24-26 in tents at the cabin. There were 28 Scouts and 4 Leaders present. The Cobra Patrol won the Patrol Competition. Seven Scouts and 2 Leaders also had a Patrol Campout at the cabin grounds in April. The Camporee was held at Hickory Park from May 22-24 and was attended by 26 Scouts and 6 Leaders. All three Patrols were Blue 'Ribbon winners at this weekend of competition. The weekend of June 19-21 was spent under the stars on the cabin grounds. Seven Leaders and 15 Scouts were present on this campout. The following Scouts also spent 8 days at Camp Bashore taking a Jr. Leader \Training Course, Danny Kuhns, Alan Treffinger, Willard Hacker, John Hawkins, and Scott  Mohr.
        The week of July 12-18 was spent at Resica Falls by 33 Scouts and 10 Leaders. Five of the Leaders were there for the full week. This week is always one of the highlights of the year and this year proved no exception. Four Scouts and one Leader were inducted into the Order of the Arrow. The Troop again won the Water Carnival. Bruce Baver won the Scout of the week Award and Ernest Guldin won the Rookie of the Year award. Another highlight of the year is the annual Father and Son Camping Trip held Aug.28th-30th. Camp Yaw Paw in Northern New Jersey as their destination as 26 Scouts, 8 non Scouts, and 28 fathers made the trip. A hike was made to a high elevation where a view of the New York Skyline, some 30 or 40 miles away, could be seen. A football game with the fathers against the sons was on the program one afternoon, The fathers were the winners in the game but the losers in the sore muscles department the next day. Gilbert Rock, Jr. held Church services on Sunday. On Sept. 11-13,18 Scouts and 9 Leaders spent the weekend at camp Rockwood. They held their water sports activities and slept in cabins. The Scouts camped in tents at Camp Bashore on Oct. 16-1-8. Bashore is in Lebanon County and is their Council's camp. Twenty-four Scouts and 13 Leaders were present. A footba11 game was staged again between the men and the Scouts with the men winners. Dale Dohner of Resica staff was a guest of the Troop. Twenty-three Scouts and 5 Leaders spent one night in the cabin with the annual Halloween party as the highlight of the evening. on Nov. 20-22, 20 Scouts and 10 Leaders camped at the cabin and on Sat., they hiked the Jockey Hollow Trail. This is a 17 mile historical hike in New Jersey, starting in Gladstone and ending in Moorestown. It is historical because of the part it played in the Revolutionary War. The trail also goes through the National Training School, Schiff Scout Reservation.
        The annual Christmas Campout was held on Dec. 27-30 at the cabin with 26 Scouts and 6 Leaders braving the cold and sleeping out in tents. This concluded 28 nights of Troop camping for the year. I am sure the Scouts and Leaders enjoyed every trip and the ones that presented the most hardships will linger in their memories the longest.
        The following Scouts were on all Troop Campouts: Scott Mohr, Mike Snyder, Harold Fetterman, Ricky Moll, Willard Hacker, Danny Kuhns, David Wentling, Alan Treffinger, and David Mack. Special mention must be made of David Mack, who has not missed a Campout since he joined Scouts and now has 103 straight nights of camping. In second place is Danny Kuhns with 79 straight nights of camping.Scott Mohr and Willard Hacker are tied for third with 73 nights, and Harold Fetterman is next with 72 nights. Scott Mohr and Willard Hacker are also Scouts who have not missed a single night of camping since joining the Scouts. The past year has been a banner year for the Scouts camping and hiking program. They are looking forward to the present year as being better than ever.

Cabin Dedication 1974
We acknowledge the thoughtfulness of those who made possible the scout cabin. This structure, built in the early forties, will serve the members of East Greenville Troop 108, Boy Scouts of America. It will help point scouts toward the Scout Oath and Law and make them better citizens. It will help scouts to grow in fellowship as they experience campouts together. Since the Delaware Indians once roamed the area and the scouts of today have received such a rich heritage from the Indians we will call our cabin Witauchsundin which in the language of the Delaware means to have fellowship with one another. What better name could we bestow on this wonderful structure.
 
We especially want to recognize the building committee, formed, March 9, 1939, of Victor Ensminger chairman, Fred Diehl, Merritt Derr, Paul Heimbach and Victor Moyer Sr., also the finance committee of Warren Krieder, Frederick Bieler Sr., Harold Roth, Quinton Swenk, Vic Ruter, Paul Steinman and Clarance Reitnauer, also to Bill Beahm, the scoutmaster and his assistant David Croll, Bill Thomas, Merritt Derr and later Harold Roth and Charles Krause, and last but not least, to the members of the Troop who helped with the labor. 
At this time Vic Ensminger whom is said to have been the driving force behind the building of the cabin, will hand the sign ""Witauchsundin."
 
1974 EXPLORERS POST 2108 REPORT
 
Starting our 1974 program of activities,
January 15th, the Explorers tried their feat at skiing on the Doe Mountain's slopes. The following Sunday, January 20th, the floors of the Civic Building basketball court were aloud with the squeaking of a fast moving Explorer basketball game. Parents often wonder how their sons behave when the boy is on his own, well arrangements were made to go skiing for a weekend at Oregon Hill.
Feb. 1, 2, 3rd, The ski lodge offered 8 person dwellings in their Motel complex with meals, lodging and tow lift supplied for  a pre-arranged price. I would like to compliment the parents for the behavior of the boys that went along. We had 14 boys and 4 adults that went skiing. The following weekend the Post attended the annual Scout Banquet and there the Post was proud to present the most active Explorer award to Gary Bilger.
March 1,2,3rd, the Perkiomen Prep School played host to the Valley Forge Council Explorer Winter Olympics Program. With the excellent coaching and planning of my assistant Glen Gilbert and the terrific effort put forth by the boys there were Gold, Silver and Bronze medals taken that weekend. The next four activities consisted of bowling at the East Greenville Fire House on March 22 and April 6, after both these bowling activities we slept at the Scout cabin.
Our next 2 activities may have been a first for some of the boys. Friday, April 26, 11 boys and 1 girl and 2 Leaders left for the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania to ride the rapids of the Pine Creek that runs through the Grand Canyon. We did this on rubber rafts on Sat., Apri1 27th. and came home Sunday, April 28th. Our next activity is one even some adults are afraid to try. Sunday morning, May 19th, we had 9 boys and 4 adults leave for the Kutztown Airport to give Sailplane flying a try. The pilots took one boy at a time to an altitude of 2000 feet, with the help of a tow plane, reaching that altitude the sailplane is cut loose to sail on its own. Each boy was given a chance to fly the plane with the supervision of the instructor pilot.
As the summer grew nearer the attendance started to fall off. We camped at the Scout cabin in May and June, but had very poor attendance.
August 18th, Terry Mayer was kind enough to invite the Post for a fishing trip on his boat, the weather was fine but the fishing wasn't. We didn't have any meetings during the summer months.
Starting the Explorer Program in fall, we scheduled a night at the Scout cabin on October 19th, and Sunday, October 20th, the boys shot clay birds at the Red Hill Gun Club. Talk of the activities is drawing more boys into the Post. The boys decided they liked Sailplane flying so they made arrangements Sunday, October 27th, to try Sailplane flying again. This time we had 18 boys and 4 adults attend.
November 10th, the boys competed against each other in a game of basketball at the Civic Building. The boys decided they would like to spend a weekend at the Scout cabin, 19 boys attended. They sawed up firewood on Saturday and Saturday night they cooked a meal for the whole group.  At 7 pm. that night the boys met at the Pennsburg Pool room for a few games of pool, returning back at the Scout cabin by 11:30. We left Sunday to come home.
The last get together of the year was our Christmas Dinner, which was held in the kitchen of the Goshenhoppen Church. At the present time our Post has 31 boys and 2 girls.

1975 
From the Troop Committee
 
The year 1975 has been another busy time for the Post and Troop committee. We participated as Chapter 1 (The Brush  Stompers) of the Brothers of the Brush in the East Greenville Centennial parade. We were also active in some of the other Centennial events, and came out as East Greenville champs of the Tug of War contest. 
With a lot of effort, our long needed wash and outhouse at the cabin has been brought under roof. There are still some odds and ends to be completed, after which we would like to build our 3rd Adirondack. The average attendance of 21 men at our Troop Committee Meetings during 1975 indicates the interest of these men for the boys of the Troop and Post. Without the support of people and business, it is almost impossible for a Troop sponsored by a group of citizens to have a good Scouting program for the boys. But because of this support, we have been able to step, into our 52nd year of Scouting. The men of the Troop and Post committee would like to extend their sincere appreciation to all supporters.

1975 Explorer Post 2108 Activities
 
The start of our activities for the1975 year was Jan.19th, at the Civic Bldg. for a game of basketball. The Explorers  played and shouted with the enthusiasm of a stampede of buffalo. This energy was shown again in Feb. when we attended an Explorer Winter Carnival at Camp Pinemere on the 14, 15, & l6th. Despite the bitter cold, our Post mustered up enough drive to come out ahead in a snowball-throwing melee. Sledding, tobogganing, skiing and snowmobile rides were enjoyed, but the dances at night seemed to warm up the boys more than anything else.
Preparations were made for the Explorer Olympics held at the Perkiomen School on March l4 -15, & 16th. The previous year we'd taken 8th place but were determined to better our record this year. The boys figured out who was going to enter certain events and who would be part of the team events. With snow on the ground, a sloppy track to run on and a very muddy field to play team handball we went all out to win. Sliding, bumping and falling in cold clammy mud some left the field with as much as 10 lbs. of mud over their clothes. They also walked away with a lst, place in team hand- ball. Other gold medals were won in volleyball, wrestling & diving. They came out second place winners in Ping-Pong, tennis, shot-put, discus, high jump, twice in wrestling, and 3 times in swimming. We took three third places. It was a very proud moment at the awards ceremony for our post to stand up and be counted as one of the best.
On April 6th, we drove to Maple Grove, Pa. to hear engines screaming and, tires smoking as cars bolted down the mile drag strip.
In May we gathered at the Upper Perk High School swimming pool for an introductory lesson in scuba diving. Everybody listened closely because after the explanations we entered the pool. Under a buddy system everyone took turns breathing underwater for the first time. A few caught on quickly but there was considerable gasps & gulping of water as our advisor (Kenny Mohr) swore we were trying to drown him. Although we tried some new things our attendance fell short as the summer drew closer. In October we re-organized and on Nov. 9th we went to the Red Hill Gun Club for some trap-shooting. There were some good shots but not up to par of the bragging done before hand.
We can't forget the nights at the cabin with basketball & card playing taking priority with the Explorers. Our new assistant for this year, Fred Zoyer, Jr. led instructions on some survival cooking. Potatoes packed in mud with bacon & eggs fried in a brown paper bag were only two of a few new tricks shown to those attending.
Overall 1975 was a very fine year with a fine group of young men joining together in an Exploring atmosphere.

1976 From the Troop Committee
 
As we look back at the year 1976, the Nations Bicentennial, it has been a good year for the Troop. The Committee's Goals have been met. The outhouse at the Scout cabin is in operation and the third Adirondack is completed and a lot of painting has been done on the porch of the cabin. We celebrated the Bicentennial by participating in the local Bicentennial  Parade as the "Brush Stompers”, Chapter l of the Brothers of the Brush. Floyd “Bubi” Treffinger, Committeeman and Assistant Scoutmaster, received his Wood Badge beads, the highest Leadership training award for a volunteer Scouter.
Average attendance at our Troop Committee meetings in 1976 was 18 men. This shows how interested the men of the Committee really are to have a good Scouting program for the youth of our Troop and Post.
Committee projects for 1977: Painting the outside of the Scout cabin with wood preserver, and some work on the inside. The fireplaces in front of the Adirondacks should be replaced.
The men of the Troop and Post Committee would like to extend their appreciation to all the People and places of business that have helped to support Troop 108 and Post 2108 in the past, and hopefully in the future. Because of this support, we are now stepping into our 53rd, year of Scouting.
I would also like to thank the Leaders, Officers, and the men of the Committee for their service to the boys.

1977 From the Troop Committee
Another year has passed, the 54rd for our Troop, and we can look back at a year of accomplishments. With the help of some of our supporters we were able to get the Deed to 1.94 acres of land across the road from our cabin.
It will be put to good use by the boys for camping and the preservation of nature. The trails from the cabin to the Adirondacks have been laid out and covered with fine gravel.
The Scouting Program of 1977 was again excellent for the Troop, and the boys and the Leaders who participated had a good time. The Troop committee would like to Thank the Scoutmaster and his Assistants for a job well done.
The average attendance at our Troop Committee meetings in 1977 was 16 men. I would like to invite the Fathers of our newer Scouts to come to one of our meetings and help us to make the Scouting program for our Troop even better.
People and places of business have supported us generously in the past 12 months, and hopefully will continue to do so in the future. The Troop committee would like to extend their sincere appreciation to all supporters, without their help we would not be able to give the Boys of Troop108 a good year of Scouting. I would personally like to Thank the Leaders, Officers, and the Men of the committee for their service to the boys.

1978 
From the Troop Committee
In looking back on 1978, the Committee has made some good accomplishments for the betterment of the Troop. We added almost 2 acres of woodland to our Troop property. The new land is located directly across the road from the cabin and will give the Troop additional camping area, as well as help preserve nature in our Valley. To update their knowledge in Leadership and Scouting skills five of our leaders participated in the cornerstone training sessions and completed the course. They were Scoutmaster Karl Winsch, Ron Rodenberger, Terry Lieler, Earl Riffert and Michael Hofke. Scoutmaster Karl Winsch and Earl Riffert also completed their Woodbadge training and are now working on the requirements to receive the Woodbadge Beads. After 2 slow years the Troop had a good year with our Christmas Tree sale and Candy sale, but it took a lot of effort on behalf of Scouts, Leaders, Explorers and Committeeman to be successful. Attendance at our monthly Committee Meetings in 1978 was an average of 17 men. We would like to thank all of our supporters for their help throughout the year, because without this support we could not give the Boys of Troop 108 a good Scouting Program.
My personal thanks goes to all the Leaders, Officers and Committeemen for their time and effort throughout the year.

The men of the Troop and post committee would like to extend their appreciation to all supporters of Troop108 and Post 2108. Without their help we would not be able to give the boys a good program.
