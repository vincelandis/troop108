        <em style="color: red">Old records indicate the first Troop meeting took place July 3, 1924
            with three Scouts and the Leaders present. </em>Assisting Scoutmaster Wotring were
            Fred Stauffer and Jake Wolfersberger, both East Greenville school teachers. The Troop committee had Dr.
            William I. Zyner as chairman and members Warren G. Fluck and Roy U. Rapp. Mr. Rapp was to serve the
            committee for 14 years until 1937.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <em style="color: red">The Troop met in the Third Street Elementary School building in East
            Greenville and weekly dues was set at 5 cents. </em>One Scout, Granville Heffentrager
            said it was "very hard to come up with 5 cent dues" since these were non-prosperous post war years. The
            dues fee incidentally remains the same, until 1974. Known to have been among the 
            <strong>First Scouts</strong> were
            <strong>Heffentrager, Bill Beahm,
                Clarence Bauman, Harold Boyer, and Paul Brunner.</strong>

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        <em style="color: red">Troop activities were probably limited the first few years and not
            until 1927 when Warren Kreider had become Scoutmaster, was the Troop to spend a camping period
            at Camp Delmont. </em>It is noted in the records that Raymond P. Erb passed the
    swimming test at camp.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        Weekly activities otherwise
                consisted mostly of hikes with Green Hill, Mill Hill and Silver Springs as its favorite places to hike
                to. Another activity was a District Campfire in September at Memorial Park, Schwenksville,
                Pa.

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: justify;">
        The Troop again camped at Delmont
                in 1928 and an increase in activities was reported in 1929 when Scribe, Ralph Engle reported the Troop
                played basketball in Realty (now Masonic) Hall and a patrol of first aid Scouts were entered in a first aid meet at the Aurora (now the Rivera
                Pizza) Theater, Pennsburg, Pa.
